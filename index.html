    <div class="indentindicator">
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Age Structure</span>
    Age is grouped into five-year intervals, ranging from individuals aged 0-4
    to 95-99.  For each age group, we document the proportion of the population
    that is male versus the proportion of the population that is female. We document the gender of the head of each surveyed household.
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Religion</span>
    We document the religion practiced by the head of each surveyed household.
    The majority of households in the Bird’s Head Seascape are either Christian or
    Muslim, with a small percentage of households practicing other religions (namely Buddhism or Hinduism).
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Ethnicity</span>
    The Bird’s Head Seascape is ethnically and linguistically diverse (Ananta et al. 2016).
     We document both paternal and maternal ethnicity for the head of each surveyed household,
     and report paternal ethnicity in Figure 5.
   </div>
<!-- Human Well being section ------------------------------>
<!-- blue title------------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>HUMAN WELL-BEING.</span>
     We synthesize data on five attributes of human well-being commonly
     identified in human development policy goals, identifying one or more leading
     indicators for each of these dimensions:
   </div>
<!-- Economic Well-Being indent--------------------->
     <div class="indent">
       <span class="greenintrotitle">ECONOMIC WELL-BEING:</span>
       the resources people use to meet basic consumption and material needs, and
       access other sources of well-being (Sen 1999)
     </div>
     <div class="indentindicator">
     <span><em>Indicator:</em> Primary Occupation</span>
We document the primary occupation (i.e., the main way a household meets their needs) in the MPA, classifying households into seven occupational categories including farming (i.e., growing crops or raising livestock);  harvesting forest products (e.g., timber, charcoal, non-timber forest products), fishing (e.g., capture of fish, crustaceans and other marine resources for sale or consumption), aquaculture (e.g., farmed fish, shrimp or seaweed); the extraction of non-renewable marine resources (e.g., sand mining; coral harvesting and mining); marine tourism (e.g., scuba dive operations), and other wage labor (e.g., medical or education professionals, government officials).
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Household Material Assets</span>
Material assets are a reliable and widely used indicator of economic well-being.  We adopt a standard ‘basket of goods’ methodology that assesses whether or not a household owns a particular asset (e.g., car, boat, telephone, television). The eleven-item ‘basket’ includes a range of goods, from low cost items (e.g., mobile phones) to high cost items (e.g., cars, boats with inboard motors).  Each asset type is weighted according to its cost, with high value items given greater weight.  We calculate a weighted sum of all the assets each household owns.
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Market Access</span>
Market access (i.e. place that most households in the settlement go to sell all their goods) shapes both human well-being, marine resource use, and the condition of marine ecosystems (Cinner 2009). We document household market access by asking how long it usually takes to travel to each household’s respective primary market.
</div>
<!-- Economic Health--------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">HEALTH:</span>
  the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization, 1946)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Household Food Security</span>
Food security is the ability for all people, at all times, to access nutritionally adequate and safe food for an active, healthy life, in a socially acceptable way (Bickel et al. 2000). The Bird’s Head Seascape social monitoring program adopts an internationally recognized standard scale  that classifies households into one of three food security categories (Bickel et al. 2000):
<div class="indentindicator2">
  <p>Food secure: Households show no or minimal evidence of food insecurity, meaning that they can access sufficient nutritionally adequate and safe food, in a socially acceptable way.</p>
  <p>Food insecure without hunger:  Food insecurity is evident in household members’ concerns about adequacy of the household food supply and in adjustments to household food management, including reduced quality of food and increased unusual coping patterns.  Little or no reduction in members’ food intake is reported.</p>
  <p>Food insecure with hunger:  Food intake for household members has been reduced to an extent that implies that household members have repeatedly experienced the physical sensation of hunger. </p>
</div>
<span><em>Indicator: </em>Child Food Security</span>
Food security is an important factor in the physical and mental development of children. Where children experience food insecurity, they may be at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies linked to physical and mental development issues (Nord 2009).  We adopt the USDA Child Food Security scale, which identifies households in which at least one child (age 0 to 17) has been hungry at times in the past 12 months, due to a lack of access to food (Nord and Bickel 2002).  Households are classified as either showing ‘evidence of child hunger’ or ‘no evidence of child hunger’.  Not all children in households showing evidence of child hunger will be experiencing hunger, but at least one child will likely be.
<span><em>Indicator: </em>Household Morbidity</span>
Morbidity (i.e., disease, disability or poor health due to any cause) can negatively impact the well-being of an individual and their family, due to emotional trauma, loss of income, or the costs of treatment. We adopt a simple measure of household morbidity, monitoring the number of days each member of the households surveyed in the MPA experienced illness or injury in the four weeks prior to survey. We convert these data to per capita morbidity rate.
</div>
<!-- EDUCATION PORTION ----------------------------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">EDUCATION:</span>
  the structures, systems and practices used to transfer knowledge and skills in a society (Stephanson and Mascia 2014)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> School Enrollment Rate</span>
We measure the percentage of school age children (between the ages of 5 and 18 years old, inclusive) enrolled in formal education in each household.
</div>
<!-- Tenure portion of methods --------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">TENURE: </span>
the way in which ownership of the land or rights to the land are organized (United Nations Development Program 2006)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Marine Tenure</span>
Marine tenure is the cultural and legal foundation of localized control of marine resources, which have been linked to both social and ecological benefits (Cinner 2005). Marine resource rights can be classified into five functional types (Mascia and Claus 2009), including the right to enter a MPA; the right to harvest fish or other resources from the MPA; the right to manage the MPA (i.e., make decisions about how resources are used); the right to exclude others from the MPA (i.e., make decisions about who can, and cannot enter the MPA); and the right to transfer marine resource rights to others (i.e., the sale or lease of rights).  The Bird’s Head Seascape social monitoring program uses a marine tenure index to measure the number of distinct marine resource rights each household has exercised in the 12 months prior to survey.  The index, which ranges from zero to five, counts the number of distinct resource rights a household has exercised in the 12 months prior to survey.
</div>
<!--Culture portion of document -->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">CULTURE: </span>
encompasses art, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO 2001)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Place Attachment</span>
Place attachment is “a positive connection or emotional bond between a person and a particular place” (Williams and Vaske 2003). Research suggests that place attachment is a strong predictor of environmentally responsible behavior and can influence environmental stewardship (Vaske and Kobrin 2001; Gosling and Williams 2010). We measure the emotional bond that households resident in each MPA have for that MPA with a standard scale (modified from Gosling and Williams 2010). The scale ranges from zero to five, with higher values indicating a stronger emotional bond to a particular MPA.
</div>
<!-- Marine Resource use and dependence section ------------------------------>
<!-- blue title------------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>MARINE RESOURCE USE & DEPENDENCE.</span>
     Marine resource use can shape both human well-being and the condition of marine resources.  The well-being of households that are highly dependent on marine resources as a source of income or dietary protein, may be closely tied to marine ecosystem health, and the population of species targeted for commercial or subsistence use.  The Bird’s Head Seascape monitoring program documents multiple attributes of marine resource use, including the frequency of fishing and primary gear types used by fishers. At the same time, we document the dependence of fishers on their catch as a source of dietary protein and cash income.
   </div>
   <div class="indentindicator">
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fishing Activity </span>
   We document a household’s frequency of fishing behavior by asking participants how often they go fishing, ranging from once every six months or never to more than a few times per week.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fishing Technique </span>
   We document the fishing technique most often used by fishers in the past six months by grouping all techniques into one of five categories. These categories include: fishing by hand (e.g., gleaning, hand lines, spear gun); stationary net (e.g. traps, gill net, and trammel net), mobile net (e.g., trawl, purse seine and beach seine); stationary line (e.g. long line);
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Economic Dependence on Fisheries </span>
   We document household income from fishing by asking participants how much of their income has come from fishing within the last 12 months.  The five categories range from “none” of their income to “all” of their income.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fish Sale Frequency</span>
   As a proxy for the commercialization of fisheries in the MPA, we document the frequency that fishing households sell at least some of their catch. Subsistence fishers may sell at least some their catch regularly, either selling surplus catch not needed to sustain the household, or high value species (Schuhbauer and Sumaila 2016).  Small-scale commercial fishers will sell their catch more frequently.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Dietary Dependence on Marine Protein</span>
   We document the proportion of dietary protein derived from fish in the last 12 months.  This indicator provides an additional measure of the potential linkage between marine fisheries and household food security.
  </div>
<!--Interpreting findings -------------------------->
<!--blue title----------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>INTERPRETING FINDINGS.</span>
     This report documents the status and trends in social conditions over time in Selat Dampier MPA. We document variation in demographics, human well-being, and marine resource use among the MPA settlements.  For continuous variables (i.e., household assets, school enrollment rate), we compare observed social conditions in each settlement against the median value for the MPA (identifying the median reference settlement in each figure) as well as the Bird’s Head Seascape MPA Network average. For all variables, we test for significant trends across the MPA, across time.
     <p>Observed changes to social conditions over time may be caused by many different social and ecological processes. For example, changes in household food security may be due to economic growth, extreme weather events affecting the availability of key foods, fuel price fluctuations, MPA establishment, or a combination of these factors. In this report, we interpret the trends in social conditions by describing the possible explanations for the patterns observed in the data. We provide subjective assessments to interpret our findings, based on expert judgment about the relative plausibility of alternative explanations for each trend. Consequently, positive trends in social conditions should not be interpreted as positive MPA impacts. Similarly, negative trends should not be interpreted as negative MPA impacts.</p>
     <p>To understand whether Selat Dampier MPA causes the changes to social conditions, the program is also monitoring conditions in similar non-MPA controls
(using the same standard protocols used in the MPAs; Glew et al. 2012). By tracking changes over time both inside the MPA and in corresponding settlements not affected by MPA establishment, we are able to determine which social changes are directly caused by MPA establishment -- and which changes are caused by other processes (e.g., market shifts, natural disturbances). For data on the short-term social impacts (i.e., changes in social outcomes caused by MPA establishment or implementation) of Selat Dampier MPA, please refer to Glew et al. 2017</p>

   <!--CHARACTERIZING UNCERTAINTY -------------------------->
   <!--blue title----------------->
   <div class="methodtitle">
        <span>CHARACTERIZING UNCERTAINTY.</span>
        Scientific monitoring always involves uncertainty. Uncertainty may occur at each step of the monitoring process -- from developing methods to data collection, analysis, and interpretation (IPCC 2013). Some uncertainties (e.g., measurement error) are easily documented and quantified, while others remain unknown (e.g., whether an indicator is an accurate representation of an unknown, true state; IPCC 2013). The relative magnitude of uncertainty can be quantified through statistical analysis or other techniques (IPCC 2013).

<span>STATUS</span>
<p>The population of Selat Dampier is youthful, with an average age of 23.0 years.  While the birthrate in Selat Dampier MPA is relatively low (13 births per 1000 individuals), the youthful population structure (indicated by height of the bars at the base of Figure 2, compared to the height of the bars for older age groups) suggests a future expansion in the MPA’s total population.</p>
<p>Based on data from 2016, men outnumber or are equal in number to women in every age group, except those aged 30-34 years old. The gender disparity is particularly pronounced among older age groups. </p>
<p><span>TREND</span></p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014, Selat Dampier MPA’s population was stable, growing at less than 1% per year.  This suggests that immigration into MPA settlements is limited. The gender balance, and age distribution of the population remained broadly stable between 2012 and 2014.</p>

<p>In 2016, wage labor was the most common primary occupation (i.e., the main way a household meets their needs) in Selat Dampier MPA, with more than one in four households (44.9%) reliant on salaried employment.  23.7% of households relied on marine capture fisheries to meet their needs, while a further 28.9% relied on small-scale agriculture.  Tourism was the primary occupation for 0.3% of households in the MPA but was concentrated in Sauandarek, where it formed the primary occupation for 14.3% of households.</p>
<p>The proportion of households reliant on marine capture fisheries as their primary occupation
  varied between settlements in the MPA.  In Sawinggrai, almost two-thirds of households (61.5%) were
  primarily fishers.  In contrast, only 2.4% of households in Solol fished as their primary occupation.  This spatial distribution of occupations may reflect the ethnic composition of each settlement (see Figure 5), as well as other economic factors, such as market access and tourism (Figure 8a).  Most households in Sawinggrai and Saproken, for example, identified as members of the Biak or Raja Ampat clans, both of which have a strong tradition of fishing within their community. Households in settlements where fishing is less common, such as Solol and Wailebet, were predominantly Batanta and
  Tepin, agriculturalists with little cultural tradition of fishing.   Settlements with a high
  reliance on wage labor (e.g., Arborek and Sauandarek) are located close to frequently visited
  scuba-diving sites (e.g., Cape Kri), and it is likely that many employment opportunities in these
  settlements are linked to tourism or its ancillary industries.</p>

<p>It is <em>virtually certain</em> (P < 0.001) that the primary occupation of households in Selat Dampier MPA has shifted rapidly since 2012.  In 2012, marine capture fisheries were the most common primary occupation for households resident in the MPA (36.7%), with approximately one in ten households (14.3%) reliant on wage labor to meet their needs.   By 2016, these proportions had reversed, with four in ten (44.9%) households reporting wage labor as their primary occupation.  The proportion of households reliant on fishing had declined by 13% to 23.7%.</p>
<p>Other occupations remained broadly stable, except for a modest increase in the proportion of households harvesting forest products (from 0% in 2012 to 3.9% in 2016)</p>
<p>The shift from fisheries to wage labor may be linked to the rapid development of Selat Dampier as a tourism destination. While the proportion of households directly engaged in tourism (e.g., operating dive boats) declined from 1.3% in 2012 to 0.3% in 2016, the growing tourism sector may create employment opportunities in ancillary service industries, providing cash income to local households. </p>

The spike in travel time may be linked to rapid fuel price inflation between 2012 and 2014, with some families forced to take public transportation as a cheaper – though, longer – alternative during this time.

<p>TA typical household in Selat Dampier MPA experiences ‘food insecurity without hunger’, meaning that household members may worry about accessing sufficient, healthy food, but that they have not had to reduce the size of meals, or skip meals due to a lack of food (Bickel et al. 2000).</p>

<p>This decrease may be linked to the rapid shift in occupations in Selat Dampier between 2012 and 2016 (see Figure 6b), and the growth of wage labor opportunities in the region making it easier to purchase safe, nutritious and socially acceptable foods.

A small minority of households (2.7%) fished infrequently (i.e., less than once every six months) or never fished.  This widespread fishing activity suggests that despite a shift in primary occupations from fishing to wage labor in some settlements, fishing continues to be an important activity in the daily life of households in the MPA.  The majority of households (96.4%) continue to rely on fish to provide at least some of their dietary protein (see Figures 19a and 19b). </p>

<p>The frequency of fishing activity is the product of many factors, including cultural traditions, market access and the presence of fishing processing facilities.

<p>In 2016, the majority of households (65.9%) in Selat Dampier MPA rarely sold their fish catch (i.e., once every six months, or never).   A fifth of households (20.8%) sell their catch frequently (i.e., a few times a week or more), but these households are concentrated in Saproken (53.9% of households in the settlement) and Saonek, where half of all households sell their catch regularly.  The concentration of fish sales in Saproken and Saonek is likely due to the presence of small-scale fish processing industries in these settlements (49% of households in the settlement).</p>
<p>The proportion of households that sell fish at least a few times per month is lowest in Solol (12.1%) and Sauandarek (14.3%), where households occupations are either farm or wage labor based. </p>

<p>It is <em>virtually certain</em> (P < 0.001) that the frequency of selling fish among the MPA households decreased from 2012 to 2016.  In 2012, 47% of households sold their catch at a few times every six months or more. By 2016, this proportion had declined to 34%. This may be linked to both the decline in fishing activity (see Figure 15b) and the shift from marine capture fisheries to wage labor (see Figure 6b).  </p>

<p>Dampier did not derive any of their cash income from marine capture fisheries.  Of the remaining third of households who are depend to some extent on marine resources for their cash income, fisheries provide most of the cash income for 17.6% of households, and a minor source of income for a further 15.9% of households.</p>
<p>These patterns reflect the shift in household occupation from fishing and agriculture to wage-labor in the MPA (see Figure 6b).  In 2016, dependence on marine fisheries was concentrated in Saonek (49.0%), Saproken (44.1%), and Sawinggrai (42.8%), where more than four in ten households derive at least half of their cash income from fishing. This ongoing dependence on marine fisheries, despite a broader shift to wage labor in the MPA, likely reflects the strong cultural tradition of fishing among the Biak, and Raja Ampat ethnic groups resident in these settlements. </p>
<p>Some dependence on marine resources continues in settlements most affected by the emergence of the tourism industry in Selat Dampier. In Kurkapa, 20.0% of households continue to derive at least some of their income from fishing, while in Arborek, 36.4% do so. Dependence on marine resources is lowest in settlements traditionally reliant on agriculture, for example, Solol where only 3.0% of households earn any cash income from fishing.  </p>

<p>Economic dependence on fisheries is declining rapidly in Selat Dampier.

At the same time, the proportion of households who rely mostly on marine fisheries as their source of cash income declined from 33.0 to 17.5%.  This reflects the rapid shift in occupations from fishing to wage labor in many settlements, particularly those in close proximity to dive tourism operations. </p>
<p>For many households, some economic dependence on marine resources remains, with a third of households (33.4%) continuing to rely on marine capture fisheries for at least some of their income.   </p>

<p>In 2016, more than two-thirds of households (68.2%) in Selat Dampier MPA relied on marine fisheries to provide at least half of their dietary protein.  For a further 28.3%, marine fish provided a source of at least some of household dietary protein. </p>
<p>Across the MPA, only 3.5% of households did not depend on fish to provide dietary protein, but most of these households are concentrated in Saprokren (8.6% of households), Sauandarek (14.3% of households) and Solol (9.6% of households).  In Arborek, Kurkapa, Wailebet, Wamega, and Yenbeser, all households relied on marine fisheries to meet at least some of their dietary protein needs. This spatial variation may reflect the cultural traditions of each settlement, as well as the emerging tourism industry in the MPA, shifting occupations (see Figure 6b) from fishing to wage labor, and decreasing fishing activity in the MPA (see Figure 15b).</p>
<p>This continued reliance on marine resources as a source of dietary protein contrasts with the rapidly declining dependence on marine capture fisheries as a source of cash income (see Figure 18b).

<p>It is <em>virtually certain</em> (P < 0.001) that dietary dependence on marine protein among households resident in Selat Dampier MPA changed between 2012 and 2016.  Between 2012 and 2014, dietary dependence on protein increased from 73.0% to 98.4% of households reliant on fish to provide at least some of their marine protein. This increase is coincident with rapid fuel price inflation across Eastern Indonesia, which reduced household purchasing power, and may have affected the cost of other protein sources.  </p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2016, dependence on marine protein declined in Selat Dampier MPA. While 96.4% of households continued to rely on marine fish for at least some of their dietary protein in 2016, the proportion of households consuming fish for at least half of their protein intake declined from 89.7% in 2014 to 68.2% in 2016. </p>

<h1>4. SYNTHESIS & RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
<div class="column">
  <div class="sr_context">
<p><em>Economic Growth</em> Households in Selat Dampier MPA are experiencing a period of rapid economic change.  Between 2012 and 2016, the most common primary occupation of households resident in the MPA shifted from marine capture fisheries to wage labor.  By 2016, almost half (44.9%) of households in the MPA relied on wage labor to meet their needs.  This rapid shift is likely linked to the emergence and growth of the tourism sector in the MPA. While few households (0.3%) report actively participating in the tourism industry (by operating dive boats, for example), it is likely that tourism is catalyzing employment opportunities in other sectors (e.g., hospitality).   </p>
<p>While the shift from agriculture and fisheries to wage labor is widespread across the MPA, it is not universal. The majority of households continue to rely on either agriculture or fisheries as their primary occupation (Figure 6a). Wage labor opportunities are concentrated in settlements close to frequently visited dive sites (e.g., Arborek and Sauandarek), creating a ‘growth-pole’ effect (as seen in other protected areas; Gupta 2015).  In other settlements, the majority of households continue to rely on either small-scale agriculture (e.g., Solol 70.7%; Wailebet 79.2%) or marine capture fisheries (e.g., Sawinggrai, 61.5%) to meet their needs.  </p>
<p>The rapid occupational shift in Selat Dampier has been accompanied by a significant increase in household economic well-being (as measured by household material assets, see Figure 7b), in contrast to declining economic well-being in some other Bird’s Head Seascape MPAs (Ahmadia et al. 2017).   </p>
<p>Fishing activity, and in particular, the sale of fish to generate income declined significantly between 2012 and 2016.  Yet, while the direct economic dependence on marine capture fisheries (e.g., for cash income) has declined (see Figures 17b and 18b), households in Selat Dampier MPA continue to rely on marine fish as a major source of dietary protein (see Figure 19b).  More than two-thirds of households (68.2%) rely on marine fish to supply at least half of their dietary protein, and almost all households (98.2%) consume at least some fish in their diet.   This continued reliance on marine fish as a protein source, and increasing importance of dive tourism to the local economy, suggests important links between the health of the ecosystem in Selat Dampier MPA, and the health of local residents.  </p>
<p><em>Food Security</em> Food security, the ability to access safe, nutritious and socially acceptable foods (Bickel et al. 2000) is increasing in Selat Dampier MPA. Mirroring broader trends in the Bird’s Head Seascape (Ahmadia et al. 2017), the percentage of households classified as food secure in Selat Dampier increased from 44.9% to 70.7% between 2012 and 2016.  When generalized to the entire MPA’s population, this suggests that 558 food insecure households in 2012 had reached food security by 2016.  Similarly, the proportion of households experiencing ‘severe’ food insecurity, (i.e., those who skipped meals or reduced portions to cope with a lack of food), declined by 14% over the same time period.  However, while average food security is increasing in the MPA, many households continue to experience anxiety over the availability of food or lack of access to sufficient food. </p>
<p>In 2016, a minority of households (8%) in Selat Dampier MPA continued to experience ‘food insecurity with hunger’. These households are concentrated in Arborek (18% of settlement households) and Kurkapa (20% of settlement households).  Food insecurity correlates with higher dependence on wage labor in a settlement, but the reasons for this are unclear, and require further examination.  </p>
<p><em>Fuel price inflation as a ‘resource shock’.</em> The rapid fuel price inflation experienced across Indonesia in 2014 likely influenced households in Selat Dampier MPA in multiple ways.  Increasing fuel prices reduced household purchasing power, affecting their material assets (Figure 7b), market access (Figure 8b), and fishing activity (Figure 15b) due to the costs of operating motorized fishing vessels.  During this time, households’ dependence on marine fish as a source of dietary protein increased (Figure 19b), suggesting that households may continue to rely on fisheries as a ‘safety net’ during resource shocks.  </p>
<p><em>Marine tenure and place attachment.</em> As the frequency fishing activity declines in the MPA, household marine tenure (measured as the number of rights over marine resources a household exercised in the 12 months prior to survey) is also declining (Figure 13b).  The proportion of households exercising their right to manage marine resources halved between 2012 and 2016 (see Figure 13b), while those exercising their right to harvest marine resources dropped to 31.6% in 2016.
Households in Selat Dampier MPA express an increasing strong emotional bond to the marine environment (known as place attachment; Figure 14b).  This is in contrast to a broader decline in place attachment among households resident in many other Bird’s Head Seascape MPAs (Ahmadia et al. 2017).   While the reason for this stronger emotional connection is unclear, it may be linked to the concentration of tourism development in Selat Dampier, increasing the recognition of the MPA as a ‘special place’ among local households.
</p>
<p><span>RECOMMENDATIONS: </span> As the local economy in Selat Dampier MPA shifts to include more wage labor opportunities (likely due to the growing tourism industry) economic well-being and food security are increasing for many residents.  At the same time, the health of the ecosystem in the MPA is broadly stable (Andradi-Brown et al. 2017).<p>
<p>To support continued sustainable development in Selat Dampier MPA, we recommend: </p>
<ul>
  <p><li><em>Manage for tourism, fisheries, and ecosystem health.</em>  When Selat Dampier MPA was established, the majority of residents relied on marine capture fisheries or agriculture to meet their needs. With the growth of tourism in the MPA, there is a need to address the increasing diversity of MPA stakeholders.  Future management plans should consider the needs of fishers and tourism operators, without compromising the health of the ecosystems on which both industries depend. </li></p>
  <p><li><em>Sustainable tourism plans.</em> Despite the rapid growth in tourism, the majority of households in Selat Dampier MPA continue to rely on fisheries and agriculture to meet their needs.  Sustainable tourism development planning is needed to ensure appropriate land-based development (e.g., hotels, resorts), avoid direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems (e.g., from anchoring vessels on reefs), as well as prevent social conflict from growing inequity in the MPA.</li></p>
  <p><li><em>Plan for possible population growth.</em> Growing tourism opportunities in Selat Dampier MPA may attract immigrants to the region. With the arrival of new immigrants may come new employment opportunities for local residents, and new ideas about sustainable development.  At the same time, continued community engagement efforts are likely necessary to ensure communities continue to understand the importance of the marine ecosystem as the foundation of Selat Dampier MPA’s economy. </li></p>
  <p><li><em>Socialize MPA regulations with communities</em>Ecosystem health in Selat Dampier MPA is stable (Andradi-Brown et al. 2017), and underpins the local economy via fisheries and dive tourism. To ensure long-term sustainability, continued socialization of MPA regulations is needed to foster compliance by the community. This should be coupled with greater stakeholder participation efforts in MPA management. </li></p>
  <p><li><em>Ensure active, representative participation in MPA management.</em>  As fewer households exercise direct rights over marine resource management and depend less directly on marine resources, it is important that community members continue to have a voice in how marine resources are managed.  Creating many and varied opportunities for participation by representative stakeholder groups (fishers, farmers, tourism operators) in MPA management will help provide legitimacy to MPA authorities, and promote compliance with MPA regulations.  These participation opportunities should also aim to foster greater participation by women.  </li></p>
  <p><li><em>Foster continued improvements in food security.</em>   For most households, food security is increasing in Selat Dampier MPA.  Some households continue to experience severe food insecurity, including households in settlements close to well-known dive sites.   Government ‘safety net’ programs targeting food insecure households will be needed to improve households’ ability to access safe, nutritious and socially acceptable foods. With the growing reliance on wage labor, these programs may be particularly important during resource shocks (e.g., fuel price inflation) that act to decrease households’ purchasing power. Nutritional education and awareness programs may also be important mechanism for supporting food insecure households. </li></p>
  <p><li><em>Foster sustainable small-scale enterprises through education.</em>   With the school enrollment rate in Selat Dampier MPA gradually increasing, education institutions have an important role to play in communicating the importance of marine ecosystems to the local economy, and providing the necessary skills to manage sustainable tourism-related enterprises. </li></p>
