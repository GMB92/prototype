    <div class="indentindicator">
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Age Structure</span>
    Age is grouped into five-year intervals, ranging from individuals aged 0-4
    to 95-99.  For each age group, we document the proportion of the population
    that is male versus the proportion of the population that is female. We document the gender of the head of each surveyed household.
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Religion</span>
    We document the religion practiced by the head of each surveyed household.
    The majority of households in the Bird’s Head Seascape are either Christian or
    Muslim, with a small percentage of households practicing other religions (namely Buddhism or Hinduism).
    <span><em>Indicator:</em> Ethnicity</span>
    The Bird’s Head Seascape is ethnically and linguistically diverse (Ananta et al. 2016).
     We document both paternal and maternal ethnicity for the head of each surveyed household,
     and report paternal ethnicity in Figure 5.
   </div>
<!-- Human Well being section ------------------------------>
<!-- blue title------------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>HUMAN WELL-BEING.</span>
     We synthesize data on five attributes of human well-being commonly
     identified in human development policy goals, identifying one or more leading
     indicators for each of these dimensions:
   </div>
<!-- Economic Well-Being indent--------------------->
     <div class="indent">
       <span class="greenintrotitle">ECONOMIC WELL-BEING:</span>
       the resources people use to meet basic consumption and material needs, and
       access other sources of well-being (Sen 1999)
     </div>
     <div class="indentindicator">
     <span><em>Indicator:</em> Primary Occupation</span>
We document the primary occupation (i.e., the main way a household meets their needs) in the MPA, classifying households into seven occupational categories including farming (i.e., growing crops or raising livestock);  harvesting forest products (e.g., timber, charcoal, non-timber forest products), fishing (e.g., capture of fish, crustaceans and other marine resources for sale or consumption), aquaculture (e.g., farmed fish, shrimp or seaweed); the extraction of non-renewable marine resources (e.g., sand mining; coral harvesting and mining); marine tourism (e.g., scuba dive operations), and other wage labor (e.g., medical or education professionals, government officials).
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Household Material Assets</span>
Material assets are a reliable and widely used indicator of economic well-being.  We adopt a standard ‘basket of goods’ methodology that assesses whether or not a household owns a particular asset (e.g., car, boat, telephone, television). The eleven-item ‘basket’ includes a range of goods, from low cost items (e.g., mobile phones) to high cost items (e.g., cars, boats with inboard motors).  Each asset type is weighted according to its cost, with high value items given greater weight.  We calculate a weighted sum of all the assets each household owns.
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Market Access</span>
Market access (i.e. place that most households in the settlement go to sell all their goods) shapes both human well-being, marine resource use, and the condition of marine ecosystems (Cinner 2009). We document household market access by asking how long it usually takes to travel to each household’s respective primary market.
</div>
<!-- Economic Health--------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">HEALTH:</span>
  the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization, 1946)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Household Food Security</span>
Food security is the ability for all people, at all times, to access nutritionally adequate and safe food for an active, healthy life, in a socially acceptable way (Bickel et al. 2000). The Bird’s Head Seascape social monitoring program adopts an internationally recognized standard scale  that classifies households into one of three food security categories (Bickel et al. 2000):
<div class="indentindicator2">
  <p>Food secure: Households show no or minimal evidence of food insecurity, meaning that they can access sufficient nutritionally adequate and safe food, in a socially acceptable way.</p>
  <p>Food insecure without hunger:  Food insecurity is evident in household members’ concerns about adequacy of the household food supply and in adjustments to household food management, including reduced quality of food and increased unusual coping patterns.  Little or no reduction in members’ food intake is reported.</p>
  <p>Food insecure with hunger:  Food intake for household members has been reduced to an extent that implies that household members have repeatedly experienced the physical sensation of hunger. </p>
</div>
<span><em>Indicator: </em>Child Food Security</span>
Food security is an important factor in the physical and mental development of children. Where children experience food insecurity, they may be at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies linked to physical and mental development issues (Nord 2009).  We adopt the USDA Child Food Security scale, which identifies households in which at least one child (age 0 to 17) has been hungry at times in the past 12 months, due to a lack of access to food (Nord and Bickel 2002).  Households are classified as either showing ‘evidence of child hunger’ or ‘no evidence of child hunger’.  Not all children in households showing evidence of child hunger will be experiencing hunger, but at least one child will likely be.
<span><em>Indicator: </em>Household Morbidity</span>
Morbidity (i.e., disease, disability or poor health due to any cause) can negatively impact the well-being of an individual and their family, due to emotional trauma, loss of income, or the costs of treatment. We adopt a simple measure of household morbidity, monitoring the number of days each member of the households surveyed in the MPA experienced illness or injury in the four weeks prior to survey. We convert these data to per capita morbidity rate.
</div>
<!-- EDUCATION PORTION ----------------------------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">EDUCATION:</span>
  the structures, systems and practices used to transfer knowledge and skills in a society (Stephanson and Mascia 2014)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> School Enrollment Rate</span>
We measure the percentage of school age children (between the ages of 5 and 18 years old, inclusive) enrolled in formal education in each household.
</div>
<!-- Tenure portion of methods --------------------->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">TENURE: </span>
the way in which ownership of the land or rights to the land are organized (United Nations Development Program 2006)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Marine Tenure</span>
Marine tenure is the cultural and legal foundation of localized control of marine resources, which have been linked to both social and ecological benefits (Cinner 2005). Marine resource rights can be classified into five functional types (Mascia and Claus 2009), including the right to enter a MPA; the right to harvest fish or other resources from the MPA; the right to manage the MPA (i.e., make decisions about how resources are used); the right to exclude others from the MPA (i.e., make decisions about who can, and cannot enter the MPA); and the right to transfer marine resource rights to others (i.e., the sale or lease of rights).  The Bird’s Head Seascape social monitoring program uses a marine tenure index to measure the number of distinct marine resource rights each household has exercised in the 12 months prior to survey.  The index, which ranges from zero to five, counts the number of distinct resource rights a household has exercised in the 12 months prior to survey.
</div>
<!--Culture portion of document -->
<div class="indent">
  <span class="greenintrotitle">CULTURE: </span>
encompasses art, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO 2001)
</div>
<div class="indentindicator">
<span><em>Indicator:</em> Place Attachment</span>
Place attachment is “a positive connection or emotional bond between a person and a particular place” (Williams and Vaske 2003). Research suggests that place attachment is a strong predictor of environmentally responsible behavior and can influence environmental stewardship (Vaske and Kobrin 2001; Gosling and Williams 2010). We measure the emotional bond that households resident in each MPA have for that MPA with a standard scale (modified from Gosling and Williams 2010). The scale ranges from zero to five, with higher values indicating a stronger emotional bond to a particular MPA.
</div>
<!-- Marine Resource use and dependence section ------------------------------>
<!-- blue title------------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>MARINE RESOURCE USE & DEPENDENCE.</span>
     Marine resource use can shape both human well-being and the condition of marine resources.  The well-being of households that are highly dependent on marine resources as a source of income or dietary protein, may be closely tied to marine ecosystem health, and the population of species targeted for commercial or subsistence use.  The Bird’s Head Seascape monitoring program documents multiple attributes of marine resource use, including the frequency of fishing and primary gear types used by fishers. At the same time, we document the dependence of fishers on their catch as a source of dietary protein and cash income.
   </div>
   <div class="indentindicator">
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fishing Activity </span>
   We document a household’s frequency of fishing behavior by asking participants how often they go fishing, ranging from once every six months or never to more than a few times per week.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fishing Technique </span>
   We document the fishing technique most often used by fishers in the past six months by grouping all techniques into one of five categories. These categories include: fishing by hand (e.g., gleaning, hand lines, spear gun); stationary net (e.g. traps, gill net, and trammel net), mobile net (e.g., trawl, purse seine and beach seine); stationary line (e.g. long line);
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Economic Dependence on Fisheries </span>
   We document household income from fishing by asking participants how much of their income has come from fishing within the last 12 months.  The five categories range from “none” of their income to “all” of their income.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Fish Sale Frequency</span>
   As a proxy for the commercialization of fisheries in the MPA, we document the frequency that fishing households sell at least some of their catch. Subsistence fishers may sell at least some their catch regularly, either selling surplus catch not needed to sustain the household, or high value species (Schuhbauer and Sumaila 2016).  Small-scale commercial fishers will sell their catch more frequently.
   <span><em>Indicator:</em> Dietary Dependence on Marine Protein</span>
   We document the proportion of dietary protein derived from fish in the last 12 months.  This indicator provides an additional measure of the potential linkage between marine fisheries and household food security.
  </div>
<!--Interpreting findings -------------------------->
<!--blue title----------------->
<div class="methodtitle">
     <span>INTERPRETING FINDINGS.</span>
     This report documents the status and trends in social conditions over time in Selat Dampier MPA. We document variation in demographics, human well-being, and marine resource use among the MPA settlements.  For continuous variables (i.e., household assets, school enrollment rate), we compare observed social conditions in each settlement against the median value for the MPA (identifying the median reference settlement in each figure) as well as the Bird’s Head Seascape MPA Network average. For all variables, we test for significant trends across the MPA, across time.
     <p>Observed changes to social conditions over time may be caused by many different social and ecological processes. For example, changes in household food security may be due to economic growth, extreme weather events affecting the availability of key foods, fuel price fluctuations, MPA establishment, or a combination of these factors. In this report, we interpret the trends in social conditions by describing the possible explanations for the patterns observed in the data. We provide subjective assessments to interpret our findings, based on expert judgment about the relative plausibility of alternative explanations for each trend. Consequently, positive trends in social conditions should not be interpreted as positive MPA impacts. Similarly, negative trends should not be interpreted as negative MPA impacts.</p>
     <p>To understand whether Selat Dampier MPA causes the changes to social conditions, the program is also monitoring conditions in similar non-MPA controls
(using the same standard protocols used in the MPAs; Glew et al. 2012). By tracking changes over time both inside the MPA and in corresponding settlements not affected by MPA establishment, we are able to determine which social changes are directly caused by MPA establishment -- and which changes are caused by other processes (e.g., market shifts, natural disturbances). For data on the short-term social impacts (i.e., changes in social outcomes caused by MPA establishment or implementation) of Selat Dampier MPA, please refer to Glew et al. 2017</p>

   <!--CHARACTERIZING UNCERTAINTY -------------------------->
   <!--blue title----------------->
   <div class="methodtitle">
        <span>CHARACTERIZING UNCERTAINTY.</span>
        Scientific monitoring always involves uncertainty. Uncertainty may occur at each step of the monitoring process -- from developing methods to data collection, analysis, and interpretation (IPCC 2013). Some uncertainties (e.g., measurement error) are easily documented and quantified, while others remain unknown (e.g., whether an indicator is an accurate representation of an unknown, true state; IPCC 2013). The relative magnitude of uncertainty can be quantified through statistical analysis or other techniques (IPCC 2013).

<span>STATUS</span>
<p>The population of Selat Dampier is youthful, with an average age of 23.0 years.  While the birthrate in Selat Dampier MPA is relatively low (13 births per 1000 individuals), the youthful population structure (indicated by height of the bars at the base of Figure 2, compared to the height of the bars for older age groups) suggests a future expansion in the MPA’s total population.</p>
<p>Based on data from 2016, men outnumber or are equal in number to women in every age group, except those aged 30-34 years old. The gender disparity is particularly pronounced among older age groups. </p>
<p><span>TREND</span></p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014, Selat Dampier MPA’s population was stable, growing at less than 1% per year.  This suggests that immigration into MPA settlements is limited. The gender balance, and age distribution of the population remained broadly stable between 2012 and 2014.</p>

The absence of female household heads in Arborek could be an artifact of our random sampling design. </p>

<p>In 2016, wage labor was the most common primary occupation (i.e., the main way a household meets their needs) in Selat Dampier MPA, with more than one in four households (44.9%) reliant on salaried employment.  23.7% of households relied on marine capture fisheries to meet their needs, while a further 28.9% relied on small-scale agriculture.  Tourism was the primary occupation for 0.3% of households in the MPA but was concentrated in Sauandarek, where it formed the primary occupation for 14.3% of households.</p>
<p>The proportion of households reliant on marine capture fisheries as their primary occupation
  varied between settlements in the MPA.  In Sawinggrai, almost two-thirds of households (61.5%) were
  primarily fishers.  In contrast, only 2.4% of households in Solol fished as their primary occupation.  This spatial distribution of occupations may reflect the ethnic composition of each settlement (see Figure 5), as well as other economic factors, such as market access and tourism (Figure 8a).  Most households in Sawinggrai and Saproken, for example, identified as members of the Biak or Raja Ampat clans, both of which have a strong tradition of fishing within their community. Households in settlements where fishing is less common, such as Solol and Wailebet, were predominantly Batanta and
  Tepin, agriculturalists with little cultural tradition of fishing.   Settlements with a high
  reliance on wage labor (e.g., Arborek and Sauandarek) are located close to frequently visited
  scuba-diving sites (e.g., Cape Kri), and it is likely that many employment opportunities in these
  settlements are linked to tourism or its ancillary industries.</p>

<p>It is <em>virtually certain</em> (P < 0.001) that the primary occupation of households in Selat Dampier MPA has shifted rapidly since 2012.  In 2012, marine capture fisheries were the most common primary occupation for households resident in the MPA (36.7%), with approximately one in ten households (14.3%) reliant on wage labor to meet their needs.   By 2016, these proportions had reversed, with four in ten (44.9%) households reporting wage labor as their primary occupation.  The proportion of households reliant on fishing had declined by 13% to 23.7%.</p>
<p>Other occupations remained broadly stable, except for a modest increase in the proportion of households harvesting forest products (from 0% in 2012 to 3.9% in 2016)</p>
<p>The shift from fisheries to wage labor may be linked to the rapid development of Selat Dampier as a tourism destination. While the proportion of households directly engaged in tourism (e.g., operating dive boats) declined from 1.3% in 2012 to 0.3% in 2016, the growing tourism sector may create employment opportunities in ancillary service industries, providing cash income to local households. </p>

The spike in travel time may be linked to rapid fuel price inflation between 2012 and 2014, with some families forced to take public transportation as a cheaper – though, longer – alternative during this time.  This trend in market access is seen across the MPAs of the Bird’s Head Seascape. </p>
<p>Trends in market access varied among settlements in Selat Dampier MPA (see Annex Figure A2), with some settlements (e.g., Yensawai) experiencing modest decreases in travel time to market, and others (e.g., Saprokren) experiencing modest increases. </p>

This trend mirrors a Seascape-wide increase in household food security, since 2010 (Glew et al. 2015; Ahmadia et al. 2017).</p>
<p>TA typical household in Selat Dampier MPA experiences ‘food insecurity without hunger’, meaning that household members may worry about accessing sufficient, healthy food, but that they have not had to reduce the size of meals, or skip meals due to a lack of food (Bickel et al. 2000).</p>

<p>While there is considerable variation in food security status among settlements in Selat Dampier MPA, food security trends are broadly consistent (see Annex Figure A3).  Food security is either stable or increasing in all but one Selat Dampier MPA settlements. In Sauandarek, 5% of households became food insecure without hunger between 2012 and 2014.

<p>This decrease may be linked to the rapid shift in occupations in Selat Dampier between 2012 and 2016 (see Figure 6b), and the growth of wage labor opportunities in the region making it easier to purchase safe, nutritious and socially acceptable foods.  Average travel time to local markets (see Figure 8b) remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2016, suggesting that the child hunger is not directly linked to market access, but may be due to household purchasing power or government support programs.</p>
